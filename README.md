# CYNAPSE — Offline-First Agent System & Synaptic Knowledge Memory

**Cynapse** is a high-performance, offline-first AI agent platform engineered entirely in 100% pure Rust. Designed for total privacy, zero external runtime dependencies, and instant local execution, it bridges host hardware telemetry with an intelligent multi-engine router, a dynamic synaptic knowledge graph, and an Atomic-Agent-inspired architecture elevation.

At the heart of Cynapse lies a unified architecture where three powerful engines work in concert: **Dendrite**, a force-directed 3D graph memory system with Coulomb/Hooke physics, SQLite FTS5 full-text indexing, and BM25 relevance ranking; **Leafcutter**, a custom pure-Rust GGUF and Safetensors execution core providing local tensor streaming with KV cache trunk reservation; and **llama.cpp / Ollama integration**, acting as a high-speed Tier-1 HTTP inference runner with NDJSON streaming and multi-provider fallback. Together, these subsystems provide a complete local agent harness capable of autonomous tool execution, strict GBNF grammar constrained outputs, real-time memory synthesis, 3D orbital galaxy memory visualization, and self-healing diagnostics—all running locally on your hardware without a single byte leaving your machine.

## Installation & Setup

### Single-Line Automated Install (Linux & macOS)
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alartist40/cynapse/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Build from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alartist40/cynapse.git
cd cynapse
cargo build --release
cp target/release/cynapse ~/.local/bin/cynapse
```

### System Health Verification
After installation, run the self-healing diagnostic to verify hardware, SIMD acceleration, storage, and database integrity:
```bash
cynapse doctor --fix
```

`cynapse doctor` exits 1 when no inference backend answers (Ollama on 11434/11435 or the llama-server daemon on 38265) and prints the exact remediation; the TUI probes those ports at startup and uses the first live one.

## Capabilities

### Synaptic Memory & 3D Galaxy Memory Atlas
Memory in Cynapse is modeled after biological neural networks with a force-directed 3D physics engine. Ideas, facts, and conversation turn logs form nodes connected by weighted synaptic links that strengthen with use and decay with disuse over time.
- **Force-Directed 3D Galaxy Physics**: Real Coulomb repulsion, Hooke spring attraction, central gravity toward the supermassive core, velocity damping (0.88), collision avoidance, and force clamping.
- **3D Orbital Galaxy Visualizer (`/memory`)**: Visualizes memory nodes as stars organized into galactic clusters revolving around a supermassive central core.
- **Two-Tier Hybrid Memory Recall**: Merges SQLite FTS5 keyword matching with BM25 scoring, specialization index weighting, and exponential temporal decay.
- **Structured Memory Micro-Channels**: Session facts, recalled knowledge, and memory index injected as structured prompt sections.

### Atomic-Agent Architecture Elevation
Six architecture phases inspired by the Atomic-Agent reference implementation:
- **Stable Zone A Prefix**: Byte-stable system prompt cached across multi-turn tool loops for KV-cache reuse.
- **Two-Phase LoopGuard**: Prospective loop detection with no-progress streak tracking, wandering detection, and circuit breaker.
- **Batch Tool Dispatch**: Array tool call parsing `[{"tool": ...}, ...]` with sequential per-call guard evaluation.
- **Notice Injection**: `=== NOTICE ===` prompt tail for loop detector and steering redirections.
- **Provider Fallback Chain**: Sticky multi-provider fallback (llama-server -> Ollama -> NativeLeafcutter) with escalating cooldowns (30s -> 60s -> 300s) and lazy probe recovery.

### Agent Loop Hardening (Stages 13-17)
Five hardening stages layered on the Atomic-Agent elevation:
- **Verified Read Receipts**: Re-reading an unchanged file within the 6-message context window returns `[File unchanged since read #N]` instead of re-sending content — verified against a content hash *and* the anchor's presence in actual model context.
- **Forced Finalization**: On step exhaustion (`MAX_AGENT_STEPS = 14`), one final no-tools turn demands an honest status report (completed / outstanding / errors) instead of an abrupt stop; a `tools_allowed` guard hard-blocks tool execution on that reply.
- **Memory Injection Sanitization**: Recalled memory is fenced with an `[UNTRUSTED MEMORY]` banner; code fences (``` -> `` ` ``) and channel headers (`===` -> `= = =`) inside stored nodes are neutralized so they cannot spoof prompt channels.
- **Concurrency-Safe Batch Partitioning**: Tools carry `concurrency_safe` metadata (`read_file`/`grep` safe, `write_file`/`execute_command` exclusive); batches partition into contiguous safe runs and singletons as the seam for future parallel dispatch.
- **Verified Reflection Admission**: Reflection distills only clean turns — tool errors, LoopGuard vetoes, step exhaustion, and stream failures set `turn_verified = false` and skip distillation.

### Agency Capabilities (Task 2, Stages 18-21)
Delegation to scoped specialist bots with fail-closed permission enforcement:
- **Bot Profiles & Registry**: TOML profiles at `~/.cynapse/bots/` (`tools_allow`/`tools_deny`/`tools_ask`, workspace restriction, persona, concurrency cap); deny beats allow, unknown tools fail closed; seeds `@coder`, `@researcher`, `@auditor`.
- **Autonomous Subagent Loop**: `spawn_subagent` runs a budgeted loop (5 steps + forced finalization) with GBNF tool parsing, LoopGuard cycle detection, cancellation tokens, and a concurrency semaphore (2); results announce back into the conversation.
- **Interactive Approval Gates**: `tools_ask` tools in background subagents pause for a `y/n` approval modal (`[tool denied by user]` on deny); inline subagents and unknown bot slugs fail closed.
- **Orchestration UX**: `@slug <task>` input routing, `/bots spawn|status|cancel` commands, 120s stall auto-cancel with `=== NOTICE ===` steering, sidebar agency telemetry, and a doctor registry check.

### Offline Agent Capabilities & GBNF Grammar Engine
- **NDJSON Streaming**: Polymorphic streaming parser supporting multiple API formats (Ollama, vLLM, generic).
- **GBNF Grammar Constraints**: Enforces valid JSON tool-call schema syntax, preventing output formatting panics offline.
- **KV-Cache Slot Affinity**: Slot 0 pinned for chat, slot 1 for reflection, with `cache_prompt: true` for warm cache reuse.
- **Max Step Safeguards**: Configurable step limits (`MAX_AGENT_STEPS = 14`) with forced finalization — one no-tools status-report turn on exhaustion prevents runaway recursive tool execution.

### Async Background Reflection
Fire-and-forget reflection worker distills conversation turns into atomic facts, procedures, and lessons without blocking the UI. Runs on a dedicated background thread after each turn completion, gated by verified-run admission: turns with tool failures, vetoes, or exhaustion are not distilled.

### Offline Model Downloader & Model Management (`/pull`)
- **Curated Recommendations**: Probes system RAM and GPU VRAM to tag optimal model sizes.
- **Custom HuggingFace Downloads**: Download any GGUF model from HuggingFace with real-time progress.
- **Background Async Progress**: Non-blocking Tokio downloader with real-time speed and progress bars.

### System Persona Manager (`/persona`)
- **Interactive TUI Modal & Live Editor**: Inspect, edit, and switch persona `.md` files in `~/.cynapse/persona/`.
- **Dynamic Prompt Compiler**: Injects direct system instructions into every model prompt without generic LLM headers.

### Cynapse Doctor Self-Healing Engine (`/doctor`)
- **13-Subsystem Auditing**: Host RAM headroom, GPU & hardware acceleration, SIMD (AVX2), model storage directory, GGUF file integrity, SQLite connection, SQLite table/index health, GBNF grammar compiler, local host tools, Tokio scheduler, Tier-1 endpoint & model catalog, persona catalog, bot registry & profile catalog.
- **Auto-Fix Mode (`--fix`)**: Automatically recreates missing directories, repairs database indexes, clears stale files.

### Visual Themes & UI Experience
- **4 Visual Color Presets**: Dark Slate, Neon Cyber, Amber CRT, Emerald Matrix.
- **Dynamic Input Box**: Expands from 3 to 8 lines as text grows.
- **Collapsible Reasoning Blocks (`Ctrl+T`)**: Expand or collapse internal model thinking streams.
- **Rich Markdown Formatting**: In-terminal syntax-highlighted code blocks, blockquotes, headers, and bullet lists.
